Grace will be working on the blog option for the final project.

Shane: he is making a shiny app that mimics what the advanced stats of English Premier league soccer players look like in the FIFA video game. He has multiple data sets to look at advanced stats on in order to create graphics showing what each players strong and weak points are. He helped me to see that I need to think of ideas of how to get outside of what we've done in class.
