Grace will be working on the blog option for the final project. She recently had contaminated water in her hometown which sparked her interest in making a reactive map to show different areas across the U.S. that have had contaminated water issues in the past. I'm not sure how long the data will go back but it will be an interesting project!

Charlie: he is making an internal R package that helps beginners with R and Rstudio and makes it easier to use. He is using ECAC hockey data to start off and will try to make the package able to manipulate the data.

Shane: he is making a shiny app that mimics what the advanced stats of English Premier league soccer players look like in the FIFA video game. He has multiple data sets to look at advanced stats on in order to create graphics showing what each players strong and weak points are. He helped me to see that I need to think of ideas of how to get outside of what we've done in class.

Kyle: He is making a shiny app similar to mine where he is looking at NFL stats from last year to make visualizations for different statistics. From collaborating with him, I learned how to do different panels within the shiny app for different visualizations which could be helpful with my own project as well.

Meyer: he is making a shiny app looking at different statistics from the MLS. You can select which region you want to look at and from there you can select a team from that league to look at statistics like expected goals, assists, value of the team, etc. Just like my partner last week, he used different tabs to make the shiny app more user friendly and cleaner which is something I'd like to incorporate in my project.
