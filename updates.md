Downloaded the NHL all_teams.csv file and read the file into R. Trying to narrow down the data set in order to find out what i want to work with. 

## March 23 Beginning of class

Sifted through the data to make a plan of where to go from here as well as got my data in a place where I can begin to manipulate it for the project. I chose to start small with the Pittsburgh Penguins data set and work out from there. The goal is to look at different variables available in the data and see if we find any interesting correlations, comparisons, or just anything that pops out. I will begin by categorizing the data by the situation on the ice (5on5, 5on4, etc.)

Continued to get my data set smaller and smaller so I can work on one particular area. Began making my first portion of the shiny app which will look at percentage of low danger, medium danger, and high danger goals for pittsburgh against each team. 

## March 28th Beginning of class

Over the weekend, I began working on the first part of my app using the low, medium, and high danger variables. As I got about an hour in and began trying to run my data that I had, I realized the variables weren't what I thought they were. Long story short, I switched my approach and began using shot attempts, shots on goal, and goals for to try to find a correlation between number of goals and shots on the power play. I'm starting small and working from there.

During class, I was able to troubleshoot some things I had going wrong with the first part of my app. I got my scatterplot to be reactive to what I wanted to show (goals for compared to proportion of shots getting through to the net) and began to plan the next part of my project. Next, I'd like to offer a shiny app where the user can decide what situation to look at (even strength, powerplay, PK) using radio buttons to see the trends in that data as well.
