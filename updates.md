Downloaded the NHL all_teams.csv file and read the file into R. Trying to narrow down the data set in order to find out what i want to work with.

Sifted through the data to make a plan of where to go from here as well as got my data in a place where I can begin to manipulate it for the project. I chose to start small with the Pittsburgh Penguins data set and work out from there. The goal is to look at different variables available in the data and see if we find any interesting correlations, comparisons, or just anything that pops out. I will begin by categorizing the data by the situation on the ice (5on5, 5on4, etc.)
